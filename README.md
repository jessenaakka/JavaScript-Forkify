Udemy JavaScript course last project.

Building architecture:
MVC pattern = Model View Controller
MVC basic idea is that when user interacts with the app, controller decides if that event should go to Model (fetching data from web api etc.) or View (manipulating DOM etc. everything the user can see) or both. Model and View never interacts with each other, data goes always trough controller.
